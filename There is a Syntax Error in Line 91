***The Error is:***

```  File "./setup-audio", line 91
    match boards[device_board]:
          ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```
***This error is due to the `match` statement is a new feature introduced in Python 3.10***
So We can fix it either:
1. Upgrade Python to 3.10 or later
2. Refactor the Code to Work with Older Python Versions

The Origibal Code is:
```
    try:
        match boards[device_board]:
            case "bdw" | "byt" | "bsw":
                hifi2_audio()
            case "skl" | "kbl":
                avs_audio()
            case "apl":
                apl_audio()
            case "glk" | "cml" | "jsl" | "tgl" | "adl":
                sof_audio(boards[device_board])
            case "stoney" | "picasso" | "cezanne" | "mendocino":
                amd_audio(boards[device_board])
            case "mt8183":
                # mt8183 only needs ucm, so just pass to make the check happy
                pass
            case _:
                print_error(f"Unknown/Unsupported chromebook model: {device_board}")
                exit(1)
```


The Reverted one is:

```
try:
    if boards[device_board] in ["bdw", "byt", "bsw"]:
        hifi2_audio()
    elif boards[device_board] in ["skl", "kbl"]:
        avs_audio()
    elif boards[device_board] == "apl":
        apl_audio()
    elif boards[device_board] in ["glk", "cml", "jsl", "tgl", "adl"]:
        sof_audio(boards[device_board])
    elif boards[device_board] in ["stoney", "picasso", "cezanne", "mendocino"]:
        amd_audio(boards[device_board])
    elif boards[device_board] == "mt8183":
        # mt8183 only needs ucm, so just pass to make the check happy
        pass
    else:
        print_error(f"Unknown/Unsupported chromebook model: {device_board}")
        exit(1)
```
